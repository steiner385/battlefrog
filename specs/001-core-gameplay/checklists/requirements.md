# Specification Quality Checklist: Core Gameplay

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-02
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

| Category          | Status |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| Content Quality   | PASS   |
| Completeness      | PASS   |
| Feature Readiness | PASS   |

## Notes

- Spec is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
- Four user stories defined with clear priorities (P1-P4)
- 20 functional requirements covering all core mechanics
- 8 measurable success criteria including learning-focused SC-004
- Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults for unspecified details
- **Clarifications completed 2026-02-02**: Visual perspective (side-view platformer) and tongue mechanics (forward only) resolved
